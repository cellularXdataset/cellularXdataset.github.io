# CellularX: A Spatial-Temporal Dataset for User-Centric Sim2Real Learning in Telco Network
We introduce cellularX, the first spatial-temporal dataset focusing on user-level network experiences within telco networks. As opposed to most existing datasets that only offer cell-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), cellularX fills the gap by offering user-grained multi-dimensional KPI data. In particular, cellularX provides a synthetic dataset for simulation-to-reality (sim2real) research to address the challenge of scarcity of real-world data for specific scenarios. Additionally, a real-world dataset collected from almost one thousand users is open-sourced. Both datasets are capable of assisting user-level network experience modeling and monitoring, e.g., anomaly detection, anomaly prediction, and root cause analysis. 

The potential applications of cellularX include

**1) Sim2real study**: cellularX provides a controlled, flexible simulation platform and a set of real-world and simulated data that can be used to generate low-cost training data, while helping to understand the reality gap in sim2real learning and facilitate a fair comparison of sim2real algorithm.
**2) AIOps for telco network**: CellularX provides real-world KPI data, viewed as a snapshot of user access and network experience. Its unique multi-dimensional indicators enhance the suitability for supporting various AIOps tasks, including root cause analysis and anomaly prediction.

#### Data Composition

<!-- width: half -->

We propose **CellularX**, a large dataset focusing on user-level network e**X**perience in **cellular** networks. It provides two sub-datasets, cellularXsim and cellularXreal, enabling a comprehensive view of the user-level network experience.

- **CellularXsim** offers a controlled environment for simulating different scenarios and investigating their impacts on user-level network experience. It includes user-level KPIs gathered from a real-world study area and data generated in a corresponding simulation environment.

- **CellularXreal** is collected by a top operator and records real-time multidimensional KPIs representing network experience over 982 anonymous users, providing an insightful snapshot of real-world user interactions and network experiences. This significantly contributes to understanding how users engage with the network in their daily lives.

By integrating these two aspects, cellularX provides a richer understanding of the user-level network experience in wireless cellular networks. To the best of our knowledge, cellularX is the first dataset that focuses on user-level network experience.

#### Content Description

<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Provide a short description of the content in a data point: -->
- **CellularXreal** dataset consists of two parts: multidimensional KPI data and cellular information, where each record corresponds to a _timestamp_ and a _sampling cell_. The data contains a significant number of missing values since not all indicators are reported for each access.
The published KPI data encompasses 982 users and consists of _eight dimensions_ of KPIs. These KPIs include uplink and downlink user experience rate, block error rate, the number of resource blocks, as well as RSRP of the service cell and uplink SINR. 

- **CellularXsim** provides **real-world KPI** data generated by user equipment while moving along four manually designed paths, as well as corresponding **simulated data** generated with six simulator configurations along the same routes. CellularXsim also includes a set of real-world data generated by randomly roaming within the study area. **Simulator configuations** and **cell infomation** are provided. Four KPI metrics are recorded, that are RSSI, SINR, RSRP, and RSRQ.

#### Usage Guideline(s)

When studying sim2real with the cellularXsim dataset, we have the following recommendations for the construction of training, validation, and testing sets. Recall that we manually design four paths in the study area when we constructed the data set. CellularXsim provides real-world data generated by user equipment while moving along these paths, as well as corresponding simulated data generated along the same routes. We recommend that these data can be used as training and validation sets. CellularXsim also includes a set of real-world data generated by randomly roaming within the study area. We encourage the use of this randomly sampled data as a testing set to validate the effectiveness of machine learning models, in order to avoid unfair comparisons caused by specific optimizations tailored to the given paths.


## Limitations and Societal Impact

### Societal Impact

#### Positive Impact

- **Enhancing Efficiency in Network Optimization and Maintenance:** Researchers and operators can better understand user-level network experiences through this dataset. For instance, they can analyze factors that may impact the quality of user experience, such as network latency and packet loss rate. In this way, they can perform network optimization and maintenance targeted at specific indicators or groups of indicators, thereby improving the overall user network experience.
- **Providing Low-Cost Training Data:** CellularXsim offers a controlled and flexible simulation platform, as well as a set of real-world and corresponding simulated data. This data can be used to generate low-cost training data, which is extremely valuable for researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They can use this data to train and test their models.
- **Enhancing Transparency and Replicability in Public Data Science Research:** CellularX is open-sourced, meaning that anyone can use and analyze this dataset for non-commercial purposes. Other researchers can validate and replicate studies conducted using this dataset, thus enhancing the transparency and replicability of public data science research.

#### Negative Impact

- **Privacy:** Although the user data in the CellularX dataset has been anonymized, it does not mean that it cannot be reverse-engineered. We have taken effort to protect users' privacy, but if malicious third parties with sufficient technology and resources gain access to this data, they may be able to re-identify some users. This could expose users' network usage habits and behavior patterns, thus invading their privacy.
- **Fairness:** The cellularX dataset primarily focuses on user-level network experiences, which could lead to the overemphasis of certain users or groups' network experiences and the neglect of others. For instance, if the dataset mainly includes data from urban areas, the needs and experiences of users in suburban areas may be overlooked in the process of using this dataset to develop or improve network services.
- **Potential malicious use:** The cellularX dataset can be used to simulate and predict user behavior under specific network conditions. This information could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as network surveillance or targeted network attacks on specific users or groups.
- **Environmental impact:** Although the cellularX dataset itself may not directly cause significant environmental impact, the computational resources required to process and analyze this dataset could generate some carbon emissions. This is a common issue in the field of AI and ML, as training and running complex models often require a large amount of electricity.


### Limitations

- **Data coverage limitations:** If the CellularX dataset is primarily collected from a specific geographic region or type of network, the findings may not generalize well to other regions or networks. This could be a limitation if you're trying to use the dataset for a broader analysis of network behavior.
- **Research limitations:** As mentioned in the dataset description, the CellularXreal dataset contains a significant number of missing values since not all indicators are reported for each access. This could limit the types of research that can be performed with the dataset.
- **Temporal dynamics:** If the data was collected over a specific period of time, it might not capture the changes in user behavior and network performance over different periods of time, such as different times of day, week, or year.
- **Interpretability limitations:** Multi-dimensional KPI data could be complex to interpret and model, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights without substantial domain knowledge.
- **Generalizability limitations:** The experiments in this paper are limited to anomaly prediction as the AIOps task, verified across multiple indicators of a single user. Although we believe that the data characteristics analyzed in the text, as well as the proposed method, have universality in spatial-temporal data within telco networks or RANs, we cannot guarantee that the results can be broadly generalized to other regions or types of networks.
